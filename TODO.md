# Replit Task

Project Description
Instructions: Using Replit, build a simple HTML & CSS-driven website made up of linked pages and styled content.

How to do it:

Create the following HTML pages, each page should have links leading to the other pages in a navigation bar at the header. For example, on the About page (home page) there should be a navigation bar containing links to the contact page, registration page and login page :
About Me (this should be your home page),
Contact page,
Registration page
Login page.
Using HTML semantics, you should have a header, main, and footer tag in each page.

About Me page: The following should be included in your About Me page (creatively use ordered and unordered lists here):
Your name
A paragraph about yourself.
Hobbies, priorities, and other skills
Somewhere on the page where it makes sense visually, add a photo of yourself.

Contact page: Create a big, fancy Contact Me button at the bottom of the home page that will load the contact page when clicked on. The contact me page should have a form with the below fields. The form should have a submit button and basic HTML validation.
Name
Email
Message

Registration page: It should have the below fields with HTML validation as well.
First Name
Last Name
Phone
Gender (dropdown)
Country
State/province
Email
password
Confirm password

Login page: Add a login page with an Email field and a password field. Add basic HTML validation to the login form. It should have a submit button with the label "Sign In."
